                Digital Water Management
            </a>
            <p class="post-description">
                Increasing global water demand and the need to maintain aging infrastructure necessitate the growth in digital water management. 
                Technologies such as AI, IoT sensors, and advanced meters enable water quality and quantity control as well as remote asset management 
                and responsible water use. Also, geographical information systems (GIS), digital twins, and augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) technologies 
                visualize and model situational scenarios to identify anomalies and prevent potential damage. 5G, blockchain and cloud technologies ensure speed 
                and data security for water management solutions. This way, digital technologies improve the decision-making and efficiency of water utilities.

                Rainwater harvesting
            </a>
            <p class="post-description">
                Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is the collection and storage of rain, rather than allowing it to run off. 
                Rainwater is collected from a roof-like surface and redirected to a tank, cistern, deep pit 
                (well, shaft, or borehole), aquifer, or a reservoir with percolation. Dew and fog can also be collected 
                with nets or other tools. Rainwater harvesting differs from storm water harvesting as the runoff is collected 
                from roofs, rather than creeks, drains, roads, or any other land surfaces. Its uses include watering gardens, 
                livestock, irrigation, domestic use with proper treatment, and domestic heating. 
                The harvested water can also be committed to longer-term storage or groundwater recharge.

                National River Conservation Programme (NRCP)
            </a>
            <p class="post-description">
                National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) is a centrally funded scheme launched in 1995 aimed at preventing the pollution of rivers. It provoide information of each state on amount sanctioned under NRCP to which city and for what purpose. Purposes included under the plan are construction of STP, river front development, low cost sanitation, afforestation etc. The details of number of schemes sanctioned and total expenditure for each state is provided.

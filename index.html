                Digital Water Management
            </a>
            <p class="post-description">
                Increasing global water demand and the need to maintain aging infrastructure necessitate the growth in digital water management. 
                Technologies such as AI, IoT sensors, and advanced meters enable water quality and quantity control as well as remote asset management 
                and responsible water use. Also, geographical information systems (GIS), digital twins, and augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) technologies 
                visualize and model situational scenarios to identify anomalies and prevent potential damage. 5G, blockchain and cloud technologies ensure speed 
                and data security for water management solutions. This way, digital technologies improve the decision-making and efficiency of water utilities.

                Rainwater harvesting
            </a>
            <p class="post-description">
                Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is the collection and storage of rain, rather than allowing it to run off. 
                Rainwater is collected from a roof-like surface and redirected to a tank, cistern, deep pit 
                (well, shaft, or borehole), aquifer, or a reservoir with percolation. Dew and fog can also be collected 
                with nets or other tools. Rainwater harvesting differs from storm water harvesting as the runoff is collected 
                from roofs, rather than creeks, drains, roads, or any other land surfaces. Its uses include watering gardens, 
                livestock, irrigation, domestic use with proper treatment, and domestic heating. 
                The harvested water can also be committed to longer-term storage or groundwater recharge.

                Wastewater Processing
            </a>
            <p class="post-description">
                Large amounts of wastewater are discharged without prior adequate treatment. Lack of control over water wastage in industrial and residential activities causes pollution of freshwater reserves. Emerging innovations in wastewater processing are trying to effectively recover spent water in different industries. Technologies such as advanced oxidation processes, adsorption/biosorption, and biological and anaerobic remedies demonstrate promising results. In combination with solar irradiation, they effectively absorb pollutants from wastewater and reduce the amount of produced sludge via microbial decomposition. This way, wastewater processing solutions mitigate contaminants to meet water demands.

            </a>
            <p class="post-description">
                Bawri is a step-well in which a person can go down by using steps to fetch water. The ancient water storage and recharging systems were known as Bawris. Bawris were mostly built in cities and large towns to collect water and deliver it to the people during droughts. The Bawris went out of favour with the arrival of piped water, and waste began to pile up in them. The Bawris, on the other hand, is being repaired and resurrected due to severe water shortages in some areas. And because of the revival of Bawris, the people in these places are managing their water needs well in spite of scanty rains in their area.

            <p class="post-description">
                The drip irrigation approach can be used to effectively manage water in agriculture. Drip irrigation is a method of watering plants that use a system of narrow pipes or tubes with small holes that transport water straight to the plant’s base. Drip irrigation delivers water to plants’ root zones at a moderate rate, allowing it to be absorbed by the soil without a runoff. Thus, drip irrigation minimises the use of water in agriculture.

                The National Lake Conservation Plan (NLCP) is being implemented by the Ministry of Environment and Forests to manage and conserve contaminated and degraded lakes in urban and semi-urban areas. Its objective was to conserve aquatic ecosystems (lakes and wetlands) by putting long-term conservation plans into action that were guided by uniform policies and standards.

                Since August 2019, the Indian government has been working with the states to carry out the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), which aims to provide drinkable tap water to every rural home in India by 2024, including those in habitations where the water quality is poor. Children are especially sensitive to water-borne diseases and contamination in drinking water. A particular effort was started in 2020 to make the provision of potable tap water supply in schools, Anganwadi centres, ashram shalas, etc. on a priority basis. As a result, 8.52 lakh (83%) schools and 8.76 lakh (78.4%) Anganwadi centres across the country now have access to tap water.
